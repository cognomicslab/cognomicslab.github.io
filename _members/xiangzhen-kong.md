Prof. Dr. Xiangzhen Kong leads the Cognomics Lab at the Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences & State Key Lab of Brain-Machine Intelligence, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. He is also Adjunct Professor at the Department of Psychiatry of Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine. His lab aims to understand the cognitive, computational, and neural basis of complex functions in human (e.g., spatial navigation and language) and the variations in both healthy individuals and patients with psychiatric disorders. The lab integrates big omics data with interdisciplinary approaches including behavioral experiments, computational modelling, neuroimaging, machine learning, imaging genetics, and neural stimulation and signal recording. 

Prof. Kong graduated in computer science in 2010 and obtained his doctorate in cognitive neuroscience in 2016 from Beijing Normal University. He then moved to the Brain Imaging Genomics research group at Max Planck Institute (Nijmegen) where he worked as a postdoctoral research staff from 2016-2020. During these years he investigated the connectomics of cognitive functions and led collaborative projects on the genetics of brain laterality. In 2020 he started his current position at Zhejiang University.
